    <h2>Why Should you Cook these</h2>
    <p>These <strong>RECIPES</strong> are nice. You can experience the <strong>WHOLE</strong> entire world of cultures. 
        Just for $7000 you can be just like me, after you give me your card you'll become the best cook New Mexico has ever seen. 
        <strong>$7000</strong> is all I'm asking, this is nice, but... its got a slight dent in the back. Super P's Used Cars</p>
